Transmitter for the Freestyle Libre FGM system

With the LimiTTer you are able to transform the Freestyle Libre FGM system into a real
Continous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS). That means that you don't have to manually
scan the sensor with the reader. The LimiTTer do this for you - every 5 minutes. It sends
the glucose value to your smartphone which must have the xDrip app installed. xDrip is really
a great and matured app for Android. It can send the glucose values to your smartwatch or
via Nightscout into the cloud. The most important feature is to having a night guard.

Please note, that LimiTTer is NOT maintained by Abbott. It is a experimental DIY project.
You will built your own individual LimiTTer. So you are responsible yourself for what you
have built. I have opened this project here because it's a invitation for all developers
out there to improve the LimiTTer.

Keen to see your design ideas. The first transmitter i have build was a non-rechargable
battery slot-in solution. But this doesn't work with coin batteries, because of the high
power load for a few seconds. It only works with a AAA 1.5V Alkaline. A CR2032 or double
AG13 slot-in solution would be cool. Maybe you will manage it ... :)
